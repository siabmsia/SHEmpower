            <em>Abortion</em> is a <strong>medical procedure</strong> commonly used to deliberately 
            terminate a pregnancy, such that it doesn't result in the birth 
            of a child. Abortion is usually done in two different ways: 
            medication abortion where the patient takes medicine to end a 
            pregnancy (which is often known as “abortion with pills”) or 
            in-clinic abortion where the patient undergoes surgical 
            procedures (which is known as “surgical abortion”). Abortion is 
            a very safe medical procedure. According to Planned Parenthood<a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion/what-facts-about-abortion-do-i-need-know" target="_blank"
            title="Visit www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion/what-facts-about-abortion-do-i-need-know"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, 
            about 1 out of 4 women have an abortion procedure by the time 
            they are 45 years old.

                    <em>Induced abortion</em> procedures have been around for a 
                    long time (We refer to these procedures as induced 
                    abortion due to the fact that naturally occurring 
                    events that lead to the termination of a pregnancy is 
                    known as a miscarriage, although the singular term 
                    “abortion” is commonly used to ). There has been a 
                    history of many different abortion techniques with 
                    the intention of terminating the pregnancy, such as 
                    the administration of abortifacient <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/ask-experts/can-i-use-herbs-to-have-an-abortion-at-home" target="_blank"
                    title="Visit https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/ask-experts/can-i-use-herbs-to-have-an-abortion-at-home"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
                    herbs, the implementation of sharpened objects, the 
                    application of abdominal pressure, and so on.

                    The enforcement of abortion laws has fluctuated over 
                    various time periods. Abortion has been practiced 
                    since ancient times, yet the legality and availability 
                    is questioned and threatened by many anti-abortion 
                    groups, who libel fundamental women's rights. While a 
                    lot of abortions rights movements led to the 
                    abolishment of many abortion bans in the 20th century 
                    and while abortion does remain legal in many Western 
                    countries, many people, who deem themselves “pro-life” 
                    question the legality of abortion rights.
